# Megalophone
An educational and live in-browser synth, for now this is a _very early stage_ work in progress.

Development takes place on [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/bdelacretaz/megalophone), the github repository is just used for Web publishing for now.

## Local test

    npm install
    npm run 11ty:dev
